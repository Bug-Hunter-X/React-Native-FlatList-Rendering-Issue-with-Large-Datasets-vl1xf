In React Native, when using the FlatList component with a large dataset, you might encounter an issue where the component doesn't render correctly, showing blank spaces or failing to display all items. This is often due to inefficient data handling or improper key assignment.  For example:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
This code might fail if `myLargeDataset` is extremely large.  Without proper optimization, rendering can be slow and incomplete.
