To fix this, use a `keyExtractor` to provide unique keys for each item in your dataset and consider implementing data pagination or virtualization using libraries like `react-native-fast-image` or `react-virtualized`.
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  //Optional: Add these for large datasets
  //windowSize={10} 
  //initialNumToRender={10}
/>
```
This improved code ensures that React Native correctly identifies and renders each item efficiently. For very large datasets, consider pagination or virtualization to only render the visible items, significantly improving performance.
